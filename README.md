# About the Algorithm Selection

Literature including Hayward (2016) suggest that the most cost-efficient transportation system is one with truly shared vehicles where all ride-matching in an urban area is optimized from a central dispatch. Furthermore, variants of the simulated annealing algorithm are often suggested as the most optimal solution, but as Jung, Jayakrishnan, & Choi (2015) note, in a taxi system with drivers (as opposed to autonomous taxis), the insertion heuristic approach is the best option to avoid driver confusion that could arise from reallocation of passenger pick-up assignments in the random perturbation process in simulated annealing. A future extension of this project could be a simulated annealing algorithm for an autonomous taxi system as in Jung, Jayakrishnan, & Park (2016), ideally with parallelized computation as accomplished with OpenMP in  Zbigniew J. Czech, Mikanik, and Skinderowicz (2010). The insertion heuristic however is an approach that is most plausible for optimizing the current paradigm of shared taxi passenger assignment.
